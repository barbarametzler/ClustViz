# CHAMELEON_CLUSTER

Python implementation of the clustering algorithm CHAMELEON[1] of 1999 and of CHAMELEON2[2] of 2019.

This repository is a modification and improvement of https://github.com/Moonpuck/chameleon_cluster, which itself is a modification and improvement of https://github.com/giovannipcarvalho/PyCHAMELEON.git

Depends on METIS for Python.

There are some slight differences with respect to the official papers; moreover, the algorithms are not optimized for performance, but for visualizing the algorithms' steps.
